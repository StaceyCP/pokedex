# Pokedex

This [pokedex](https://lustrous-quokka-db794f.netlify.app/) is a full stack personal project using my own express [pokemonAPI](https://pokemon-api-eb4q.onrender.com/api) to fetch pokemon data and present it in a simple react app.

Being a bit of a pokemon nerd I wanted to go one step further with this project and so I recreated an old school pokedex to present the data in a more visually appealing way.
